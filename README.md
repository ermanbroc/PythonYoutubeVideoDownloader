# Video Downloader Application

## Computer Application to Download Youtube Videos in MP3 & MP4 formats

### Description

Utilizes basic tkinter functions to create a graphical user interface for the user to either submit links for downloading,
or providing a .txt file with links to parse through and populate the UI with. The user then decides a format to download
the video(s) in.

### Purpose

In order to fuel a hobby of making mashups, I developed this to avoid downloading youtube audio from sketchy websites.

### Requirements

Need to test application on an alternate machine to determine.

### Example

Run the program, and either download [example.txt](example.txt) and open it with the program or try typing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ in the search bar.
